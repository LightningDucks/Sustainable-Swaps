# Sustainable-Swaps
Hello! Welcome to our project Sustainable-Swaps
## Our Goal
Nearly ⅔ of Americans are willing to pay more for sustainable products, but 74% of them don’t know how to identify what’s sustainable. 
Finding sustainable swaps can be very time consuming, and discourage customers who want to be eco-friendly. 
An individual has to research and read through all of the materials and ingredient lists to determine if  a product is sustainable. 
According to Business Wire, a majority of people also have doubts when companies claim to be environmentally friendly, and 45% of 
Americans only trust a company statement through a third-party validating source, which is where we come in!
